Well, this is supposed to be the home for a small Pokémon project: A Pokémon GO Pokédex. A pokedex.json, to be exact.
The Pokédex currently includes:
- Number
- German Name
- English Name
- Kilometres per Egg (a.k.a.: Which egg is this Pokémon found in?)
- Kilometres per Candy (for the Buddy System)
